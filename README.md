# Solubility_of_Molecules

# ML Model Training and Testing with IPython Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains an IPython Notebook (`Solubility_of_Molecules.ipynb`) where machine learning models are trained and tested using the Delaney solubility dataset with descriptors. The models implemented include Linear Regression and Random Forest. Additionally, matplotlib is used to create scatter plots for visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models can be found at the following URL:
[Delaney Solubility with Descriptors Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv)

## Requirements
To run the IPython Notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
